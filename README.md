# Pearâ€™dev Aircraft Assessment App

## Overview
The Pear'dev Aircraft Assessment App for Apple Vision Pro leverages mixed reality (MR) technology to provide an educational tool for aircraft inspections, self-directed embodied learning, and online assessments. This application transforms the way assessments are conducted by integrating voice memos in an immersive MR environment.

## Features
* Voice Memos for Next Steps: Record voice memos and transcribe in real-time during inspections to document next steps and action items for specific aircraft parts.
* Mixed Reality Inspections: Overlay scenario-relevant text and images directly on the aircraft using MR.
* 3D Component Visualization: Interact with 3D models of aircraft components to better understand their condition
